This is a text test and there will be more information in the future.

Thus just to be sure I will keep on blabbing about totally nothing and 
see if you keep on reading. Banana Ice-Cream and some Pina Colada 
would make life more pleasant. Now some annoying intergers like 5 
and dont forget about the weird 3.14 which equals pie. I like pie, do 
you like pie? Sincerly a tired programmer. \n
A space it required at the end of sentence to make if flow nice
like I am not doing now, the words clunck, is clunck a word?, together. 
This is better, used space character after together.\n
This should be a new paragraph/line, is it true? \n
What happens if I talk too much and try to divide by zero?
Will something cool happen?
Dunno
Lets find out now by just rambling on about totally
nothing
or 
someting
